The audio samples can be uploaded or any audio can be used after converting it into 16-bit mono audio and then into hex samples. 
Run the LPC Verilog code and change the path in the testbench code. Follow the same steps for Golomb coding. 
Output will be a bin file in compressed form.
A coefficient file is required only when using a new audio. 
The MATLAB code can be used for reconstruction of hex file, which may take some time.
convert the hex file back to audio.
